# Module 3 Challenge - Customer Banking

## Overview
This is a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Running the program
`python customer_banking.py`

## Notes
I created two functions
- is_float: to make sure it's a valid input for decimals
- pad_left_spaces: to format the print out
